                <div id="aboutMe">
                    <p>I spent the first eight years of my professional career in the Cargo Insurance industry, but after my job was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic I decided to go back to school.  I enrolled in a program to learn web development, a skill that had piqued my interest for years.  While I still draw on my experience with insurance and cargo transportation, I have come to appreciate the versatility that coding provides.  It is certainly a skill that is sought after in many industries, and I'm excited to dive into my next venture wherever it might be. </p>
